                <p>Hamster Adventure is a short pixel-style platformer game. This project demonstrates my skills in Python, as well as other areas of game development such as arts and design.
                     Throughout the production process, I have learned to apply my coding knowledge practically and overcome issues with debugging first-hand. 
                     The challenges of implementing physics, gravity, and collision proved to be difficult yet rewarding experiences, where my problem-solving skills were tested and compelled to grow. 
                     Combining mathematics and programming, I calculated the movement speed and velocity of the player character so as to be easy and flexible to control.    
                     Establishing how the player interacts with the environment and various objects proved a complex task, but with my knowledge, I managed to create a functioning gravity and collision system.

                <p>
                    Furthermore, level design was another aspect that I had the chance to explore and delve into through the creation of Hamster Adventure, enabling me to create a fun and engaging
                     map with great replay values. Creating innovative and interactive objects while play-testing them through trials and errors ultimately made for a memorable player experience.

                <p>Fchem Studio is akin to a digital diary of sorts. It is my personal website where I share my creative works in the fields of Arts, Photography, and Poetry. In this little corner of the internet, I express my outlook on the world and realize my artistic vision.

                <p>
                    Through this project, I have learned to apply my knowledge in HTML and CSS, allowing me to experience the process of front-end web development first-hand.
                    Logical layout and screen compatibility were aspects to which I paid special focus during production in order to achieve a more functional 
                    and user-friendly design. The result was a responsive website, which showcased my personality and hobbies while being engaging and interactive.
